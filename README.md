This repo contains the capstone project of Misk Data Science Immersive 2021-12.
The idea of this project is to analyzing peopleâ€™s opinion regarding certain hashtag by checking their tweets.


### Phase 1 - Setup

The file phase1_import_tweets.py has the script to import the tweets using Twitter API api.search_tweets. in order to be able to run this file you have to have twitter developer account to obtain Twitter API Security codes. I hide my own for security purpose. 

To run this file you have to have config.ini file that contains your own API twitter security key, it should be saved as following:

api_key = 'YOUR API Key'

api_key_secret = 'YOUR API Key Secret'

access_token = 'YOUR Access Token'

access_token_secret = 'YOUR Access Token Secret'

### Phase 2 - Data Collection

I target the topic of Ukraine/Russia war to analyze people opinion through their tweets all over the worlds. I was able to importe more than 26000 tweets that contains either Ukraine, Russia or #UkraineRussiawar hashtag. I used this data as a raw dataset for my forject.

### Phase 3 - Data Cleaning & EDA

### Phase 4 - Final Report
